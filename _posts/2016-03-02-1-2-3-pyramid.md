description: "Put client interests first. Always. Treat people how they deserve to be treated. Grow continually. (You're either growing or dying, there is no \"maintaining\".) What else do you need? With foundations like that set inside your firm, every future decision becomes more clear. Now get to work defining your own foundational principles - stealing these or not."
