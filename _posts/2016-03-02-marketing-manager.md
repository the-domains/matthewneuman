description: "Does this make sense to you? Someone spends $100,000, $200,000 or $300,000 a year to market new clients into their firm. But when I ask basic marketing return on investment, cost of client acquisition and budgeting questions, they're at a loss for words. Why? Because they're \"too busy\" to know."
